            <p>The POS (Point of Sale) system I am developing for my project is designed to streamline sales and inventory management processes. It features an intuitive interface that allows users to efficiently manage transactions, track stock levels, and generate sales reports. This system aims to simplify operations for small to medium-sized businesses, reducing manual errors and enhancing productivity. Currently, I am focusing on key functionalities such as product management, real-time inventory updates, and receipt generation. As an ongoing project, my goal is to ensure the system is user-friendly, reliable, and secure. This project serves as a practical application of the skills Iâ€™ve gained this semester, and I aim to complete it successfully by the December finals. </p>
